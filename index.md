## Welcome to my lambda collections

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/girardi69/LambdaCollections/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for you

The intent of this repository is to host a series of lambda collections explained to help me remind basic features and basic coding principles.
